Diffusion models have garnered significant attention from both the general public and the machine learning community since their introduction. Huggingface provides the diffusers library, enabling developers to swiftly construct diffusion models. Rather than fine-tuning existing models and harnessing the diffuser library, we opted to create a compact diffusion model from scratch. This involved crafting the Unet along with its fundamental components, the diffusion process, and the conditioning module. Due to limited computational resources, we trained the model using a small and straightforward dataset called ["Cartoon Set"](https://google.github.io/cartoonset/download.html). 

The aim of this blog is to delve into the fundamentals of diffusion models via a practical experiment and to share insights gained from training and fine-tuning these models.

[The notebook of this hands-on lab](https://github.com/WuyangLI/ML_sessions/blob/main/diffusion_models/cartoonset_diffusion/cartoonset_diffusion_conditional_v5.ipynb) does conditional image generation on Cartoon Set by a diffusion model.
The code is modified from [cloneofsimo/minDiffusion](https://github.com/cloneofsimo/minDiffusion), [TeaPearce/Conditional_Diffusion_MNIST](https://github.com/TeaPearce/Conditional_Diffusion_MNIST), and [LucasDedieu/Denoising-Diffusion_Model_Flower102](https://github.com/LucasDedieu/Denoising-Diffusion-Model-Flower102/blob/main/diffusion_model.ipynb).

# Dataset and Preprocessing
Cartoon Set is a collection of 2D cartoon avatar images, as illustrated below.

We apply the following preprocessing to images:
1. Central crop 360 pixels
2. Resize to 64 by 64 images
3. Convert int8 to float, in the range of [-1, 1]

The first important takeaway is that adjusting input tensors to the appropriate range significantly speeds up the model's convergence.

As [Djib2011](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/users/34269/djib2011) explained in his answer to the question ["should-input-images-be-normalized-to-1-to-1-or-0-to-1"](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/54296/should-input-images-be-normalized-to-1-to-1-or-0-to-1)

A popular way to combat this is by initializing the weights of the network in smarter ways. Two initialization techniques have proven to be the most popular: Glorot initialization (sometimes referred to as Xavier initialization) and He initialization, both of which are variations of the same idea.

Initially, I attempted to train a basic diffusion model without any conditions. 
<p align=center>
  <img src="figures/conditional_diffusion-diffusion.drawio.png" alt="basic diffusion model" width="400"/>
</p>
In my first trial, I normalized the image tensors to fall within the [0, 1] range. 
However, after the first epoch of training, the model didn't show much learning and generated random noise as output. 

<p align=center>
  <img src="figures/figure1_vanilla_diffusion_0_ep0.png" alt="figure 1" width="800"/>
</p>
It took around 4 epochs for the model to begin generating images that weren't just white noise.

<p align=center>
  <img src="figures/figure2_vanilla_diffusion_0_ep4.png" alt="figure 2" width="800"/>
</p>
Subsequently, when I adjusted the image tensors to the [-1, 1] range, the model started learning the features of avatars more rapidly. The model is able to generate the following samples after training for the first epoch.

<p align=center>
  <img src="figures/figure3_vanilla_diffusion_1_ep0.png" alt="figure 3" width="800"/>
</p>
As seen in figure 4, it took 6 epochs for the model to produce some images resembling faces. 

<p align=center>
  <img src="figures/figure4_vanilla_diffusion_1_ep6.png" alt="figure 4" width="800"/>
</p>

By "epoch 39," the model managed to capture attributes such as skin tone, glasses, eye color, eye shape, and various hairline shapes.

<p align=center>
  <img src="figures/figure5_vanilla_diffusion_1_ep39.png" alt="figure 5" width="800"/>
</p>

However, the model struggled to learn different hairstyles and to paint them in good colors. 
Clearly, the model exhibits a strong bias as it consistently produces images depicting men with a beard and large grey hair around the face. Could this be a case of "mode collapsing," akin to the enigmatic issue encountered in GANs?

In one word, for diffusion models, it's essential that the normalized pixel values fall within the range of [−1,1] because Gaussian noise has zero mean and unit variance. 

# Conditional Diffusion Model
We overcome the "mode collapsing" problem by constructing a conditional diffusion model aimed at generating cartoon avatars with given attributes. As depicted in the diagram, it comprises three key components: the conditioning module, UNet featuring attention mechanisms, and the diffusion process.

<p align=center>
  <img src="figures/conditional_diffusion.drawio.png" alt="conditional diffusion model" width="800"/>
</p>

The primary emphasis of this blog centers on the modifications I introduced to transform the vanilla diffusion model into its conditional version. Except the conditioning module (Tau) and attention modules (MultiHeadCrossAttention), the foundational building blocks of the UNet and diffusion process are largely adapted from the two repositories referenced earlier.

### Conditioning Module 

Add gist for Conditioning module
  
The conditioning module receives avatar attributes in numerical form and produces conditioning embeddings utilized within the attention modules of the UNet. Essentially, this module functions as a series of linear projections, transforming avatar attributes into an embedding space. This space proves more effective within the attention mechanism, working in tandem with extracted image features across various scales.

There are two noteworthy findings to highlight from this process.

**Finding 1: Representation of Attributes**

Using one-hot vectors versus original attribute values has yielded different results in conditioning the model.

Initially, I employed the original attribute values, creating a vector composed of 18 integers as the conditioning input. It took the model approximately 2 epochs to generate facial-like outputs and about 10 epochs to accurately represent various facial characteristics corresponding to the input conditioning attributes.

Here are randomly selected samples of generated images with conditioning attributes presented in the form of a vector of 18 integers.

<p align=center>

</p>
<p align=center>figure 9 - epoch 10 with original attributes</p>
However, when each attribute was treated as categorical features and concatenated into a single comprehensive binary vector (217), surprising results emerged. The model remarkably produced face-like images after just one epoch of training from scratch. By epoch 10, it managed to capture different hairstyles, although the hair color remained predominantly grey or white.

</p>
<p align=center>figure 11 - epoch 10 with binarized attributess</p>


**Finding 2: Condition Module - number of projections**

number of projections of the Tau module

The module Tau reminds me of the Mapping network in [StyleGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf)

<p align=center>
  <img src="figures/mapping-network-style-gan.png" alt="" width="400"/>
</p>

Does higher complexity of the Tau module lead to improved generated images? Regrettably, no, solely relying on the Tau module doesn't bring about significant improvements.

Introducing attention and Tau to the original diffusion model enables us to train a model that adeptly captures most avatar attributes, with the exception of color. To address this color issue, I experimented with doubling the number of Tau's projections. However, merely increasing the projection count doesn't seem to notably enhance the results.

By the 9th epoch, the model managed to generate green hair! It accurately captured the outlines and shapes of avatars, yet the color accuracy remained a challenge. 

<p align=center>
  <img src="figures/figure12_conditional_diffusion_2_ep9.png" alt="figure 12" width="800"/>
</p>

Even beyond epoch 20, the color of the generated random samples continued to be inaccurate.

### Attention Modules in UNet
[Attention vs Multi-head attention](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/25148/what-is-different-in-each-head-of-a-multi-head-attention-mechanism)

In order to facilitate the model's understanding of colors, I exchanged the simple attention mechanism with a multi-head attention setup, consisting of 4 heads.

Interestingly, this shift to multi-head attention allowed the model to finally grasp the concept of the colors of hair.

By the 9th epoch, as shown in the randomly generated images, the model demonstrated the ability to generate hair colors spanning grey, white, brown, yellow, and blond!
<p align=center>
  <img src="figures/figure13_conditional_diffusion_3_ep9.png" alt=figure 13" width="800"/>
</p>

However, the decrease in loss wasn't consistent beyond epoch 9. From a qualitative standpoint, there wasn't a noticeable visual enhancement observed between epoch 9 and epoch 18. Notably, there were perceptible artifacts such as green or blue pixels appearing on faces or hair.

</p>

### Magic Interaction Between Multi-head Attention and Tau Module
Following the incorporation of multi-head attention into the model, to further address the hair color issue discussed above, I increased the number of projections in Tau twofold while maintaining the number of heads unchanged. 

Despite noticing minor imperfections on the face and in the background, we successfully completed the training of our avatar diffusion model!

### Other Learnings
#### Noise Level
While it may appear evident, discovering an appropriate noise level for the forward process is essential. It's imperative to visualize the forward process before commencing model training. If the noise level is excessively high, the model will continue to produce random noise even after several epochs of training.
<p align=center>
  <img src="figures/noise-level-screenshot.png" alt="" width="800"/>
</p>

#### Learning Rate Schedule
Similar to training any other neural networks, establishing an effective learning rate schedule holds significant importance, particularly when aiming to train a model capable of generating high-quality images.

Regularly create checkpoints for the model and closely monitor the loss. If you observe the loss stagnating or suddenly experiencing a substantial increase, it's advisable to significantly reduce the learning rate.

#### Lower loss doesn’t promise better image quality
A decrease in loss doesn't guarantee improved image quality. In certain instances, the model effectively learns hair colors after the 10th epoch. Yet, beyond this point, although the loss continues to decrease steadily, the model appears to disregard the knowledge it previously acquired regarding hair color.
